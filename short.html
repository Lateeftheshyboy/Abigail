    <h4>I'm actually out of words</h4>
    <p>However, it's your birthday... <br>
    There are too many cliche messages out there, <br>
    and I do have a feeling you're probably tired of all <br>
    those. But do i have a choice? No. It was last night <br>
    I learnt today is your birthday. <br>
<br>
    Off all things, I'm glad I started talking to you this <br>
    year. Trust me, I sleep better these days just realizing <br>
    I now have an angel as a friend. <br>
<br>    
    In a particular letter, I stated how your beauty is very <br>
    powerful. Hey, I wasn't capping. I'm very serious. I am <br>
    very glad God thought of creating you. I laugh when <br>
    people talk about 7 wonders of the world. <br>
<br>
    There are no 7 wonders of the world. It is a man made <br>
    lie. The only wonder of the world is you, ABIGAIL. <br>
    Today, it is my prayer that you live long and have <br>
    everything beautiful life has to offer. <br>
<br>
    I also wish to explicitly state that I'd personally love to <br>
    experience your beauty someday. It'sprobably <br>
    impossible, but my pastor says it's good to be hopeful. <br>
    <br>
    If you're not traveling, I'd like to invite you to family <br>
    breakfast or lunch on Christmas Day... Lol. It's fine if <br>
    you can't come. <br>
<br>
    I curated some pictures for you below. <br></p>
